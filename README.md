# Flour-Math

## What is this?

This is a basic single page tool that takes the complexity out of calculating your gluten or protien content in your bread flour.

## How acurate are these calculations?

I sourced the formulas for these calculations from the interwebs. I'm not a math genius, but it all seems pretty logical.

If you notice discrepancies or better ways to do any of these things, feel free fork and submit a pull request.

## Future plans

I had thought to (but won't likely-- no time) add some additional functionality to this, such as:
* Drop down selector of common brand name flours to auto-populate flour stats (serving size / protien)
* Flour amount (Cups) to weight (grams) calculator, generic or brand based calculations
